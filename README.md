# Stock Market Dashboard Pro

**Stock Market Dashboard Pro** is a Python-powered web application designed to help users visualize and analyze stock market trends in real-time. This project leverages financial data from Yahoo Finance and provides interactive charts, key metrics, and historical performance analysis for selected stocks.

The backend is built with **FastAPI**, which serves as the core API for fetching and processing stock data. The frontend (React/Next.js) renders a clean and responsive interface, enabling users to quickly interpret market movements. Data visualization is handled using libraries like **Plotly** and **Pandas**, ensuring that insights are presented in a visually appealing and comprehensible manner.

Key features include:
- **Real-time Stock Data:** Fetch and display live stock market information.
- **Historical Charts:** View trends over different time frames.
- **Customizable Ticker Search:** Analyze any stock symbol supported by Yahoo Finance.
- **Sample Data Mode:** Offline testing using pre-downloaded CSV datasets.

The repository also includes sample CSV datasets (data/) for three major Indian companies — Reliance Industries, TCS, and HDFC Bank — allowing testing without a live internet connection.

Whether you’re a stock market enthusiast, a data analyst, or a developer exploring financial data APIs, this project provides a strong foundation for building advanced market analysis tools.
